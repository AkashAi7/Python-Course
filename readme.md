## Getting Started

To get started with this course, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org).

Once you have Python installed, you can run Python code using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or you can use a text editor and run the code from the command line.

Here for this course we have used Jupyter for the better learning envirnment. You can refer to this for Jupyter installation[install jupyter guide](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
You can also upload this on Jupterlab if you want to go for easy setup [JupterLab setup](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jupyter/jupyterlab_installation_and_getting_started.htm)

The course is divided into modules, and each module contains several lessons. You can start with the first module and work your way through each lesson, completing the exercises and projects along the way.

Each lesson includes code examples and explanations to help you understand the concepts. Feel free to experiment with the code examples and modify them to see how they work.

## Course Resources

In addition to the lessons, you will find additional resources to support your learning:

- **Exercises:** Throughout the course, you will find exercises to reinforce the concepts you've learned. Try to solve the exercises on your own and compare your solutions with the provided solutions.

- **Projects:** At the end of each module, you will find a project that allows you to apply what you've learned in a practical way. The projects will challenge you to solve real-world problems using Python.

- **Documentation:** Python has extensive documentation available online. The official Python documentation at [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org) is a valuable resource that provides detailed information about the Python language and its standard library.

- **Community:** Join online communities such as forums or social media groups dedicated to Python programming. Engaging with other learners and experienced developers can help you learn and grow as a programmer.
